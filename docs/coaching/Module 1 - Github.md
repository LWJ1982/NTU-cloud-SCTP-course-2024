# Comprehensive Guide to Git

## Introduction to Version Control and Git

Version control is a system that allows you to track changes to files over time. Git is a distributed version control system that enables multiple people to collaborate on a project simultaneously.

### Key Concepts

- **Repository (Repo):** A directory that contains your project and its entire version history.
- **Commit:** A snapshot of the changes made to files at a specific point in time.
- **Branch:** A separate line of development within a repository.
- **Merge:** Combining changes from one branch into another.
- **Pull Request (PR):** A request to merge changes from one branch to another.
- **Remote:** A version of your repository that's hosted on a server.

## Installation and Setup

### Installing Git

- [Official Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads) provides installation packages for various platforms.
- Follow installation instructions specific to your operating system.

### Configuration

Configure Git with your name and email:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
```

## Basic Git Commands

### Initializing a Repository

```bash
git init
```

### Cloning a Repository

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

### Checking Status

```bash
git status
```

### Staging Changes

```bash
git add <file_name>
```

### Committing Changes

```bash
git commit -m "Commit message"
```

### Viewing Commit History

```bash
git log
```

### Creating a Branch

```bash
git branch <branch_name>
```

### Switching Branches

```bash
git checkout <branch_name>
```

### Merging Branches

```bash
git merge <branch_name>
```

### Pushing Changes to Remote

```bash
git push origin <branch_name>
```

### Pulling Changes from Remote

```bash
git pull origin <branch_name>
```

### Creating and Applying Pull Requests

1. Push your changes to a remote branch.
2. On the repository's webpage, create a pull request from your branch.

## Collaborative Workflows

### Forking Workflow

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your forked repository.
3. Add the original repository as a remote.
4. Create a new branch for your changes.
5. Commit and push your changes to your fork.
6. Create a pull request from your fork to the original repository.

### Feature Branch Workflow

1. Create a branch for a specific feature.
2. Develop the feature and make commits.
3. Merge the feature branch into the main branch.

## Advanced Git Topics

### Rebase

```bash
git rebase <branch_name>
```

### Interactive Rebase

```bash
git rebase -i <commit_id>
```

### Git Reset

```bash
git reset <commit_id>
```

### Git Cherry-Pick

```bash
git cherry-pick <commit_id>
```

### Git Bisect

```bash
